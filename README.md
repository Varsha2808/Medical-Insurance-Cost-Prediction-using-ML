# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-ML

The "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction" project involves loading and preprocessing medical insurance data. The dataset includes information such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations were performed to understand the distributions of key features. Categorical variables were encoded, and various regression models were built, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance with a high R-squared value (0.91) and low mean squared error. The final model was serialized using pickle for future use. Technologies utilized include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
